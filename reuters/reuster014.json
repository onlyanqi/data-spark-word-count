Total\nLiffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,\nor 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.\n    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on\nthe year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bond\nvolume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.\n    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected\nin part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,\nwhile the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relative\nstability of U.S. Credit markets.\n    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures\nsector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT-\nSE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in\nthem should be much higher by end 1987.\n    FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an\nincrease of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the\nsame months of 1986.\n    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the use\nof stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,\nJenkins predicted.\n    Commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts\nand bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possible\nvariety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one\nsector would be volatile enough to attract trading.

Total\nLiffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,\nor 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.\n    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on\nthe year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bond\nvolume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.\n    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected\nin part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,\nwhile the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relative\nstability of U.S. Credit markets.\n    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures\nsector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT-\nSE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in\nthem should be much higher by end 1987.\n    FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an\nincrease of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the\nsame months of 1986.\n    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the use\nof stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,\nJenkins predicted.\n    Commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts\nand bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possible\nvariety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one\nsector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The current\nsituation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Ones\nchangeable, might alter completely in coming months.\n    A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness should\ncome with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added.\n REUTER\n&#3;</BODY>",

The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds\nyesterday.\n    Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index,\nunchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's\nfinish.

The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds\nyesterday.\n    Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index,\nunchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's\nfinish.

Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis\npoints lower to one basis point higher.\n    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32\nto yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.\n    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul\nVolcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to\nnarrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,\nsizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little\nexchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his\nviews.\n    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under\npressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations\nmeet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.\n    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the\nsession on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but\nthat otherwise there was little activity in this sector.\n    \"When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it\nmakes people think the Fed is not going to tighten,\" a bill\ntrader said. \"But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers.\"\n    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points\nbelow their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills\nrose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.\n    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.\n    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply\ntemporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect\ninjection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a\ndirect injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed\nconducted at its usual intervention time.\n    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8\npct.

Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis\npoints lower to one basis point higher.\n    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32\nto yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.\n    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul\nVolcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to\nnarrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,\nsizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little\nexchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his\nviews.\n    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under\npressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations\nmeet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.\n    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the\nsession on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but\nthat otherwise there was little activity in this sector.\n    \"When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it\nmakes people think the Fed is not going to tighten,\" a bill\ntrader said. \"But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers.\"\n    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points\nbelow their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills\nrose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.\n    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.\n    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply\ntemporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect\ninjection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a\ndirect injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed\nconducted at its usual intervention time.\n    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8\npct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,\ndown from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.\n    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at\nmidday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.\n Reuter\n&#3;</BODY>",

He might have to pay with the presidency.\n    Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to\npick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of his\nterm will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney has\nbeen lobbying for a six-year term.\n    Sarney came to power, without facing presidential\nelections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21\nyears of rule.\n    Although there was wide public support for direct \nelections for president, the military as one of their last\nacts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more\ninfluence, make the choice.\n    The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician who\nheaded the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), which\nhad opposed military rule.\n    In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves chose\nSarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial\npost of vice-president. But Neves died before he could take\noffice and Sarney took power.\n    He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado\nPlan was wildly popular with inflation-weary Brazilians.\n    But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not\nbeen the same.\n    \"The country is a rudderless ship,\" said a U.S. Diplomat,\nechoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea\nof how to tackle the economic crisis.\n    Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism\ncoming from the business community, the trade unions, some of\nthe military, the media and political opponents.\n    Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney's decision\nannounced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68\nbillion dlrs of foreign debt.\n    A motor industry executive said: \"The business community\nthinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimes\nharsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in\norder.\"\n    Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but\ndisagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the end\nof February they have organized national strikes of seamen,\nbankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local\nstoppages and protests.\n    Economic problems have prompted criticism from some\nmilitary figures, including the last army ruler, General Joao\nFigueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost daily\nmilitary men deny there is going to be a coup.\n    If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of\nSarney's fate will be the PMDB's leaders. So far, they have not\ntaken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.\n    But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedly\nsaid yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the\nConsituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency\nwhenever it wished.\n    In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism.\n    One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of the\nJornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:\n    \"President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it\nis just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state\nof the country and the people since the immense failure of the\nCruzado Plan.\n    \"The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the\nenticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too\nprofound.\"He called for direct elections early in 1988 as the\nonly way out of the present crisis.\n    One of Sao Paulo's leading news magazines, Senhor, said in\nan editorial this week: \"The anarcho-populist government of\nPresident Jose Sarney has failed.

Against the mark,\nthe dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180\nin Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.\n    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially\ncatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.\n    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be \"large\nenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal\nrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a\nnarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.\"\n    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. \"It\nwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as\na defender of the currency,\" said one trader.\n    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance\nMinister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long\nconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this\nafternoon.\n    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for\ncurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role\nthe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to\nprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.\n    \"Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only\nperson who will make a difference is Baker,\" said Alan Rose of\nFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.\n    \"The key question for the currency market is whether the\n(Reagan) administration will have a change of view to the\ndollar. If not, the dollar is going lower,\" he added.\n    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen\nwas linked to the market's perception that Washington was\nunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances\nand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least\ndisruptive way of accelerating the process.\n    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of\nattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh\npositions until later in the week.\n    \"We are reserving judgement for the time being,\" said Doug\nMadison of Commerzbank Ag.\n    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling\ntrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at\n1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.\n    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.\nopinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest\npopularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.\n    \"Sterling still seems to be on the firm side,\" said one\ndealer.\n    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger\ntone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from\n1.3080/85 yesterday.\n    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,\nthe dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below\naverage market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct\nyesterday.\n Reuter\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\n",

Volcker was just fulfilling his role as\na defender of the currency,\" said one trader.\n    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance\nMinister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long\nconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this\nafternoon.\n    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for\ncurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role\nthe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to\nprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.\n    \"Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only\nperson who will make a difference is Baker,\" said Alan Rose of\nFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.\n    \"The key question for the currency market is whether the\n(Reagan) administration will have a change of view to the\ndollar. If not, the dollar is going lower,\" he added.\n    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen\nwas linked to the market's perception that Washington was\nunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances\nand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least\ndisruptive way of accelerating the process.\n    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of\nattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh\npositions until later in the week.\n    \"We are reserving judgement for the time being,\" said Doug\nMadison of Commerzbank Ag.\n    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling\ntrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at\n1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.\n    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.\nopinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest\npopularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.\n    \"Sterling still seems to be on the firm side,\" said one\ndealer.\n    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger\ntone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from\n1.3080/85 yesterday.\n    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,\nthe dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below\naverage market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct\nyesterday.\n Reuter\n&#3;</BODY>",

Others argue the merger\nwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\nnetwork from scratch.\n    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\nexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\nand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\nwisdom of some of those moves.\n    \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\nit's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \"We don't want to make waves.

Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel\nsteering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a\nmodel with the new steering will be out by mid-year. Mazda aims\nto ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will\ndepend on initial consumer reaction.\n    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated\nfour-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.\nToyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field\nat a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will\nuse the system in the near future.\n    Though major U.S. And European automakers have also\nresearched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are\nwaiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for\nfurther improvements in safety and costs.\n    Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into\nparking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns. \n    Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve\nsafety. \"At extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more\ncontrol,\" said one official. \"On slippery surfaces or at high\nspeeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle.\"\n    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Honda\nengineer said: \"This invention is not intended to improve\nsafety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily.\"\n    Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to\nturn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow\nspeeds but in the same direction at high speeds.\n    Honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but the\ndirection of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the\nfront wheels.

  "text": "&#2;\n<TITLE>JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS TURN TO FOUR-WHEEL STEERING</TITLE>\n<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>\n<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Major Japanese automakers are gearing up\nto equip sporty models with four-wheel steering, a feature that\ncould become standard on high-grade cars in the future,\nautomotive industry sources said.\n    Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, they\nsaid. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel\nsteering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a\nmodel with the new steering will be out by mid-year. Mazda aims\nto ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will\ndepend on initial consumer reaction.\n    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated\nfour-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.\nToyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field\nat a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will\nuse the system in the near future.\n    Though major U.S. And European automakers have also\nresearched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are\nwaiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for\nfurther improvements in safety and costs.\n    Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into\nparking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns. \n    Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve\nsafety. \"At extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more\ncontrol,\" said one official. \"On slippery surfaces or at high\nspeeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle.\"\n    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Honda\nengineer said: \"This invention is not intended to improve\nsafety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily.\"\n    Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to\nturn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow\nspeeds but in the same direction at high speeds.\n    Honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but the\ndirection of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the\nfront wheels. With Nissan's system the rear wheels move only\nparallel to the front.\n    Automakers say professional drivers who have tested the\nfour-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling.\n    An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer said\nfour-wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it is\nuncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or\nprofits. \"All automakers are interested in something new,\" he\nsaid. \"If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want to\nfollow.\"\n    The official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick\nto sell cars. \"It's a benefit of a secondary nature compared\nwith devices for fuel economy or emission control.\"\n    General Motors Corp has developed a four-wheel steering\nsystem, but is unlikely to market it within the next five\nyears, Y.
